# CalculatorApp

Simple calculator created with React.JS

## General Information

This project is just a simple calculator created for Frontend Mentor challenge: 
https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/calculator-app-9lteq5N29

My work is in no means perfect, I'm just starting my React adventure and this was my very first project created using React.

## Features

- Simple Calculator
- Theme toggle with three different themes to choose from
- Works on most mobile devices

## Project Status

Project is complete.

## Room for Improvement

- Numbers representing themes above toggle slider are currently missing
- Code is messy 
- Should add more comments to explain some solutions
- Some of the solutions I chose are overly complicated

### To sum up

I tried to do my best while creating this project and I've learned so much about React. 

I hope that my calc can be of use to somebody.
